# NST_Scrape

NST_Scrape is a simple Python package for scraping National Hockey League information and stats from Natural Stat Trick.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install NST_Scrape.

```bash
pip install NST_scrape
```

## Usage
Currently, three functions are available in the package:

SkaterScrape
BioScrape
TeamScrape

Note that these are not particularly comprehensive, as they were developed exclusively to generate public data visualizations for the WeakSide Breakout Analysis hockey page.
